# I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
### 1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data
### 2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization
# II. Instructions:
Download the ECE Board Exam 2 dataset found on this link: bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset and write a
Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter
notebook in the dedicated submission bin.
ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM: Using data wrangling and data visualization technique with
storytelling, analyze the data and present different (i) data frames; and (ii) visuals using the dataset given.
1. Create the following data frames based on the format provided:
Example: Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas
Output:
Name Gender Track Math
S4 Male Instrumentation 65
S11 Female Communication 48
S22 Female Communication 64
a. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as
Instrumentation and hometown Luzon
b. Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is
constant as Mindanao and gender Female
2. Create a visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade. Does
chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contributes to a higher average score?
