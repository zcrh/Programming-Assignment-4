# Data Wrangling and Data Visualization

## I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization
## II. Instructions:
Download the ECE Board Exam 2 dataset found on this link: bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset and write a
Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter
notebook in the dedicated submission bin.
ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM: Using data wrangling and data visualization technique with
storytelling, analyze the data and present different (i) data frames; and (ii) visuals using the dataset given.

a. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as
Instrumentation and hometown Luzon

b. Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is
constant as Mindanao and gender Female

2. Create a visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade. Does
chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contributes to a higher average score?
